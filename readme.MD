# Multiscale CNN

This is a simple implementation of a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) in PyTorch. The idea of this model is to pass innput images through multiple scales which allows the model to learn global features and local features at different scales.

The file `multiscale.py` contains the model definition and `example.py` contains an example of how to use it.
